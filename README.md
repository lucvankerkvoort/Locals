# Locals

This is a travel application that allows people to connect with local's to whatever destination they want to go to.

You can use the application to find local's at your destination who will provide services much like a tour guide would do.
Local's can add tour routes and points of interest to their routes and even add a rate.

A peer-to-peer travel application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Flexbox/CSS Grid were used for layout. Google Maps, Google Directions and Google Images API's were used to build this application.

# How to run the application in your local environment
1. Make sure you have node, npm, and MongoDB installed, as well as a text editor. 
2. Clone the repository to your local environment, and in the home directory of the application run "npm install".
3. Make sure you have MongoDB up and running on your computer. Run "mongod" in terminal and then "mongo" in another tab in terminal.
4. Once all these steps have been completed, run the following in your text editor to open the application in your local host.
```
npm start
```
5. To run the application in a build environment, run the following.
```
npm run build
serve -s build
```
